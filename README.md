## Docs

StoryServer is an online image and metadata publishing service designed to serve relatively small collections of curated images, or stories. StoryServer is ideally suited for publishing editorials, galleries, portfolios, and other short visual narratives.

We are currently in an early alpha stage of development, which means that while we have some great features coming we're not ready to open our doors just yet. Feel free to request an invitation, and we'll send an invite and registration details for an early release of StoryServer when it's ready.
